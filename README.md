### User Stories:
Maryam listens to a song, and wants to see what her friends think before she makes a concise opinion, she opens the app and checks the songs rating average based on her friends ratings. 

Hugo is looking for new songs to listen to, but he does not want to listen to a bad one. He believes his friends have good music taste, so he looks at his friend's high rated songs to find some new music to listen to. 

Anzar is loving this new album released by one of his friends and he wants to support him by giving him a good rating, he opens Music IntelliJence and gives him a good rating (5/5 stars).

Benny doesn't like music very much, he doesn't get the hype around it. He doesn't like loud noises and gets really grumpy when he hears Christmas caroling. To vent his frustrations, he signs up for Music IntelliJence and leaves many mean comments and low ratings on Mariah Carey's classics.
