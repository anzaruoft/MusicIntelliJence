### Project Description:
InTune is a music-focused application designed for music enthusiasts, particularly teenagers and young adults. It integrates with Spotify to allow users to discover songs, rate music, and view other friends ratings and profiles. 

### Features:
- Spotify Api Integration: - Search for Songs via Spotify.
- Music Rating System: Rate and review songs on a scale of 1-5, and add an optional comment.
- Observe other people's profiles. 
- Personalize the experience with options for password management.

### User Stories:
1) Maryam listens to a song she hasnâ€™t heard in a long time, and she remembers rating it on INTUNE a while back. She wants to see what her old rating was before she makes an opinion, she opens the app, logs in and realizes it took her awhile to remember her password! She changes her password, relogs back in, and checks to see her old rating on her feed.

2) Hugo is looking for new songs to listen to, but he does not want to listen to a bad one. He cannot remember the songs he used to like, so he goes on his own profile, and views his past top songs to find something to jam out to!

3) Anzar loves this new song released by a Spotify artist and he wants to support him. He opens up the application and searches the song up by pressing "+" on the main page of the application, then searching for the song. He then leaves a great rating and comment on the song!

4) Benny overhears Greg and Darnell laughing about their funny InTune usernames at Church. Benny really likes Darnell's username and wants to check that Darnell's username is taken on the InTune app. He quickly writes down the username and clicks the profile search button ins the InTune feed page, and types in Darnell's username. Benny was very happy to find that the username was not taken.
