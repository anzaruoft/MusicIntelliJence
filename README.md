Anzar Alvi (anzaruoft), Hugo Hudson (hudsonhu22), Maryam Hassan (maryamhassan1), Benjamin Konishi (PromiscuousSquirrel).

### User Stories:
1) Mi hears of a new app and wants to create an account. They input their email, a username and a password by clicking on the signup button, then are directed to the log-in page and log in using the username and password.
   
2) Maryam listens to a song and wants to see what her friends think before she makes an opinion, she opens the app, logs in and  realizes it took her a while to remember her password! She changes her password, accesses the application, and checks to see if her friends have rated it on her feed, and looks at their review.

3) Hugo is looking for new songs to listen to, but he does not want to listen to a bad one. He believes his friends have good music taste, so he goes on his own profile, views his list of friends, goes to his best friend's profile, and finds a song to listen to.

4) Anzar loves this new song released by one of his friends (an up-and-coming Spotify artist) and he wants to support him. He opens up the application and searches the song up by pressing "+" on the main page of the application, then searching for the song. He then leaves a great rating and comment on the song.

5) Benny doesn't have any friends yet, and he over-hears Greg and Darnell at Church exchanging usernames of the application. He quickly writes down the usernames he eavesdropped, and downloads the TuneTribunal app and adds them as friends, in hopes this small step will blossom into real life friendships.
