### User Stories:
1) Mi hears of a new app and wants to create an account. They create a new username and password by clicking on the signup button, then are directed to the log-in page and log in using the username and password.
   
2) Maryam listens to a song and wants to see what her friends think before she makes a concise opinion, she opens the app and checks to see if her friends have rated it on her feed, she realizes none of her friends have, so she makes an original opinion. 

3) Hugo is looking for new songs to listen to, but he does not want to listen to a bad one. He believes his friends have good music taste, so he looks at his friend's high-rated songs to find some new music to listen to.

4) Anzar loves this new album released by one of his friends and he wants to support him by giving him a good rating on one of his songs, he opens Music IntelliJence and gives him a good rating (5/5 stars).

5) Benny doesn't like music very much, he doesn't get the hype around it. He doesn't like loud noises and gets really grumpy when he hears Christmas caroling. To vent his frustrations, he signs up for Music IntelliJence and leaves a mean comment on Mariah Carey's song, “All I Want For Christmas Is You”
