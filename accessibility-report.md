Principles of Universal Design:
1) Equitable Use:
- InTune has the same interface for all users, avoiding stigmatization and segregation of users.
- Users have the same privacy and security, where other users' information besides their usernames 
and posts cannot be accessed by other users.
- Add multilingual support to make it more inclusive for non-English speakers. Adding a color-blind-friendly interface to make it more inclusive for users with visual impairments.
2) Flexibility In Use:
- The app accommodates mouse and keypad controls on a laptop for different user preferences.
-  Flexibility in the app, where the interface is intuitive with buttons leading to every command such as 
- rate song, search song, and change password.
- Add features to customize font size, and button placement to suit individual needs.
3) Simple and Intuitive Use:
- The app has a simple layout and is not unnecessarily complex, and each feature is labeled very clearly to 
- avoid confusion.
- The app does what the user would expect, i.e., all use cases are met
- rovide interactive tutorials for first-time users to simplify onboarding.
4) Perceptible Information:
- Essential information is legible
- Future implementation: audio for button clicks, audio for adding friends, etc.
5) Tolerance for Error:
- The close button for the app is in the top left of the panel, away from key buttons
- If a song title doesn’t exist, a warning appears
- If a user doesn’t exist, a warning appears
6) Low Physical Effort:
- There is no physical effort for using the app besides being able to hold a device that uses the application. 
7) Size and Space for Approach and Use:
- Future implementation: add a setting so that users can enlarge the screen or move buttons to an area of the screen 
- that is more accessible to the user



Our program, InTune, targets music enthusiasts who are on social media and can share and rate their opinions 
on songs. This is more inclined to young adults and teenagers, who are actively kept up to date with music 
trends and want to share their opinions with their friends. If InTune were to sell, it would be marketed on 
social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat to target this young music audience. 
This app is ideal for users to discover new music and engage in a collaborative experience with their 
friends to get what their thoughts are on music. 


Our program is less likely to be used by certain demographics, such as non-English speakers, as it does not 
offer support for multiple languages, limiting accessibility. Additionally, younger people may feel more 
appealed to use this app while older people may use it less, as Spotify is predominantly used by people 
under 35 as statistically shown by The Social Sheperd (1). This creates a potential inequality between younger 
and older users, which signifies challenges in achieving rational and democratic equality, and failing to 
design for inequalities causes tangible harm and rational inequalities. Our app could be inaccessible to 
people who are blind or suffer from visual impairments, as well as those who are deaf or suffer from hearing 
problems.  Considering both the medical model and social model of disability, the future directions of this 
app could consider accounting for color blindness in the user interface design, as our interface is pink. 
Addressing these concerns would allow our app to enhance inclusivity, and expand the app’s accessibility.
